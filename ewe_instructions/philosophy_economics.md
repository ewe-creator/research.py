# The Economics of Ewe: Money is an Abstract Token

**Core Thesis**: For Ewe Creator, "Money" is not Fiat Currency. It is an **Abstract Token of Validated Truth**.

## 1. What is the Asset?
In traditional tech economics, the asset is the *Software License* (SaaS) or the *User Data* (Ads).
In Ewe Economics, the asset is **Stability**.
*   **Source**: The Codebase (Ewe.py).
*   **Value**: How resistant it is to the "Chaos of Technology."

## 2. The Currency: The Abstract Token
If Money is abstract, how do we measure wealth?
We measure it in **Testimonials**.
*   Every time a user validates the framework with a success story, they "mine" a token.
*   This token proves: "Real work happened here."

**Equation**:
`Wealth = (Number of Validated Cycles) × (Difficulty of Problem Solved)`

## 3. Why "Abstract"?
We call it abstract because it does not transact in a bank account, but it accumulates **Leverage**.
*   A framework with 0 tokens has 0 leverage (No one uses it).
*   A framework with 1,000 High-TIR Tokens has infinite leverage (It sets the standard).

## Conclusion
We are not building to sell. We are building to **accumulate proof**.
For the Ewe Creator, the highest ROI is not cash exit, but the **Permanence of the Creation**.
