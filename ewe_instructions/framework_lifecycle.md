# The Lifecycle Engine: Why Testimonials Matter

**Core Insight**: A framework's lifecycle is sustained by **proof of utility**.

## Testimonials as Fuel
Testimonials are not just "nice to have" quotes; they are the heartbeat of the ecosystem.

### 1. The Validation Loop
The lifecycle stays alive through a continuous loop of creation and validation:
1.  **Creation**: Dev A builds something valuable using the framework.
2.  **Testimonial**: Dev A shares their success story.
3.  **Signal**: Dev B sees the testimonial -> "This tool is safe and effective."
4.  **Adoption**: Dev B adopts the framework and builds something new.
5.  **Repeat**: The cycle continues.

### 2. The "Dead Project" Signal
*   **Silence = Death**: A repository with no recent success stories feels abandoned, regardless of commit dates.
*   **Pulse Check**: Testimonials provide a social pulse that proves the technology is relevant *today*.

## Implementation Strategy
*   **Showcase Section**: Dedicate a section of your docs to "Built with Ewe".
*   **Impact Metrics**: Track not just GitHub stars, but *deployed projects*.
