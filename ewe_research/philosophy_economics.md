# The Economics of Ewe: Money is an Abstract Token

**Core Thesis**: For Ewe Creator, "Money" is not Fiat Currency. It is an **Abstract Token of Validated Truth**.

## 1. What is the Asset?
In traditional tech economics, the asset is the *Software License* (SaaS) or the *User Data* (Ads).
In Ewe Economics, the asset is **Stability**.
*   **Source**: The Codebase (Ewe.py).
*   **Value**: How resistant it is to the "Chaos of Technology."

## 2. The Currency: The Abstract Token
If Money is abstract, how do we measure wealth?
We measure it in **Testimonials**.
*   Every time a user validates the framework with a success story, they "mine" a token.
*   This token proves: "Real work happened here."

**Equation**:
`Wealth = (Number of Validated Cycles) × (Difficulty of Problem Solved)`

## 3. Why "Abstract"?
We call it abstract because it does not transact in a bank account, but it accumulates **Leverage**.
*   A framework with 0 tokens has 0 leverage (No one uses it).
*   A framework with 1,000 High-TIR Tokens has infinite leverage (It sets the standard).

## Conclusion
We are not building to sell. We are building to **accumulate proof**.
For the Ewe Creator, the highest ROI is not cash exit, but the **Permanence of the Creation**.

## 4. The Paid-to-Free Strategy: A Complement, Not a Contradiction

Ewe.py starts as a **paid service**, then becomes **free**.

This is not a contradiction to the Abstract Token model; it is a **complement**.

**The Logic**:
1.  **Paid Phase**: Early adopters pay for access. This filters for serious users who will generate High-TIR testimonials.
2.  **Validation Accumulation**: As testimonials accumulate, the framework proves its stability.
3.  **Free Phase**: Once stability is proven (enough tokens mined), the framework becomes free to maximize adoption and leverage.

**Why This Works**:
*   Paid users fund the research phase without diluting the vision.
*   Free users inherit a **battle-tested** system, not an MVP experiment.
*   The transition from Paid → Free signals: "We have accumulated enough proof. Now we scale."
