# Collaborator Invitation Template

**Subject**: Building [Specific Domain] with Ewe Creator

Hi [Name],

I saw your work on [Project/Article] and thought you'd be a great fit for what we are building.

## What is Ewe.py?
Ewe.py is a Python framework built for stability and research. We focus on building tools that actually work and last.

## Why Contribute?
Ewe Creator (that's me) is building this with people who care about making things that matter.
*   **Build Real Tools**: We are currently building the [Specific Component, e.g., Testimonial Engine].
*   **Solve Real Problems**: Your code will help solve actual stability problems in tech, not just fix bugs.
*   **Work Together**: We don't just want code; we want to build the solution with you.

**Here is your invitation link:**

Let's build this together.

Best,

[Your Name]
